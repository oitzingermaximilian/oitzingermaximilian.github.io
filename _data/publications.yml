  description: "Examines how the EU can meet its 2030 domestic sourcing targets for solar PV modules. The study models learning rates for material recycling and finds that strategic stockpiling is crucial for meeting benchmarks in the late 2020s and early 2040s, complementing domestic remanufacturing."

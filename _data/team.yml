  role: "Group Lead"
  bio: "Sebastian Zwickl-Bernhard is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Energy Economics Group at the Institute of Energy Systems and Electrical Drives at the Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), where he heads the Energy System Modeling team 'From Minerals to Megawatts' (ES3M). His PhD research focused on the role of natural gas networks in the energy transition, particularly their decommissioning and repurposing for hydrogen and biomethane transport. Currently, his research - together with his team - centers on cross-sectoral modeling of clean-tech supply chains, the analysis of transformation pathways for energy-intensive industries, and market dynamics of LNG and critical raw materials. Since 2022, Sebastian has been an Adjunct Researcher in the Department of Industrial Economics and Technology Management (IØT) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). He holds a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from TU Wien."
